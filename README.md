AP Physics Demos
==============

Alex Gould and Michael Shumikhin's final AP Physics B project. We're going to create a bunch of physics simulations.

We'll probably make use of the [PhET Subversion repo](https://phet.unfuddle.com/a#/repositories/23262/browse?path=/trunk) and the [PowderToy Wiki](powdertoy.co.uk/Wiki.html).

Updates to come soon!
